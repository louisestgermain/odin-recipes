        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 oz brown rice noodles</li>
            <li>1 zucchini</li>
            <li>1 red pepper</li>
            <li>half a yellow onion</li>
            <li>2 carrots</li>
            <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1/2 cup peanuts, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup fresh herbs like cilantro, green onions, and basil, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the sauce, you'll need the following ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp fish sauce or vegan fish sauce substitute</li>
            <li>3 tbsp brown sugar (or another sweetener)</li>
            <li>3 tbsp chicken or vegetable broth</li>
            <li>2 tbsp white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chili paste (sambal oelek)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the uncooked noodles in a bowl of cold water to soak. Spiralize the zucchini, red pepper, and onion into noodle-like shapes. Cut the carrots into very small pieces (or spiralize them, too, if they’re big enough).</li>
            <li>Shake up the sauce ingredients in a jar.</li>
            <li>Heat a tablespoon of oil over medium high heat. Add the veggies – stir fry with tongs for 2-3 minutes or until tender-crisp (if they are not spiralized, they might need longer). Be careful not to overcook them – they’ll get soggy and heavy. Transfer to a dish and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add another tablespoon of oil to the pan. Drain the noodles – they should be softened by now. Add the noodles to the hot pan and stir fry for a minute, using tongs to toss. Add the sauce and stir fry for another minute or two, until the sauce is starting to thicken and stick to the noodles. Push the noodles aside to make a little room for the egg – pour the beaten egg into the pan and let it sit for 30 seconds or so. Toss everything around with the tongs. The egg mixture will stick to the noodles and everything will start getting sticky.</li>
            <li>Add in the vegetables, toss together, and remove from heat. Stir in the peanuts and herbs and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
